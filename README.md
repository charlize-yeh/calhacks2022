## Inspiration
We wanted a centralized, personalized place to take our practice midterm and final exams while being timed/paced. 

## What it does
The website provides a timer and a centralized set of practice exams for you to take your exam and time yourself while taking it, making studying both more efficient and convenient. Everything is in one place, as the website provides a list of courses at UC Berkeley to choose from for practice exams, making the entire studying process more organized and less stressful. 

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the web application. 

## Challenges we ran into
Creating the widgets/dropdown menu for practice exams and formatting the web pages were difficult at first. Ensuring that the components were visually appealing and having an accurate timer provided some thorough problem-solving, especially doing it all for the first time. The time crunch and wifi issues resulted in us having to simplify our website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the idea we came up with and the potential that it has in the future. In addition, we like the flow and organization of our web pages, and the drop down menu and timer. 

## What we learned
Putting together all of the components (form the navigation bar to the drop down menu) required coordination of architecture of the HTML code (especially with the CSS code if wanted to be done efficiently). 

## What's next for PractiCal
We hope to expand the database of practice exams and begin to provide specialized questions for users (creating user login/profile) when we continue this further! In addition, we want to create a ML algorithm to classify different problems into problem types and provide the user with information about what topics they need more work on as well as personalized problem sets including these problems.

## Built With
CSS, Figma, HTML, JavaScript, ParseHub, Timer
